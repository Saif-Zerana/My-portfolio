# Portfolio Website 

## Overview
Welcome to my Portfolio Website Project! 🎉 This project showcases my journey in web development and the skills I have acquired along the way. 

## Technologies Used
In this project, I have utilized the following technologies:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website.
- **SASS**: For more efficient and organized CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website looks great on all devices.
- **CSS Animations**: Adding interactive elements to enhance user experience.
- **CSS Grid**: For creating complex layouts easily.
- **CSS Flexbox**: For flexible and responsive layout structures.

## Project Highlights
- I challenged myself by not sticking to any predefined design and instead created the website from scratch.
- I chose the colors and design elements, stepping out of the conventional design box 🎨✨.
